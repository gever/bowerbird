# Bowerbird To Do Items and Wish List
*** is next priority to do

## NEWEST ITEMS (not yet categorized or just highest priority)
***- deal with JSON corruption (not just on reset, but happened mid-usage!)
***- custom instructions (pull request from Bernie, may need html tweak)
***- update to sql (instead of tinydb) for robustness
***- whitelist our handlers/pages so we're not hammered by crawlers
***- reset should archive json (or whatever db) (along with status folder items)
***- auto refresh for enchilada, etc.
[possible workaround: browser plug-in to do the refresh]
***- map view filtering first priority: pilots with Driver assigned
***- Retrieve view shouldn't be "previous" logic: set up just with simple show vs. no show based on pilot_status mod driver_assigned (at least for now)
**- DR0 isn't fully resetting as needed (should NOT show up on Retrieve view)
**- driver status messages (in/out/full/iamhere) (like pilot_status, but for drivers) [how will work best??]
**- add column to Driver List for their messages/status (and/or another tile board)
**- sort order for Drivers? (was by DR code, but isn't now?)
**- Fix driver view color coding
**- make markers clickable in map view
*- add nouns/filters to map view (first priority: all versus all minus PUP)
*- "NOT" showing up again now that filter has been disabled (in overview).
*- "stop" for bowerbird so json isn't corrupted by systemctl stop/restart
[For now: do NOT deploy anything while Bowerbird is live]
*- reset should clear json
[For now: manually delete json after stopping service (then start and do a /reset)]


## Webpage items
- find a better solution than rewriting index request path
- make something more elegant for rendering static pages (or is it for differentiating static/nonstatic pages? see bb.py)
- Password protected area (for Admin: provide links to admin commands, such as reset)
- Add SSL
- Require authentication for debugging and showing complete pilot details
- Organizer (Manage/Admin) view (when hidden/pw protected from public)
-- direct access to /reset
-- direct access to /refresh
- Move all the HTML out into a template
- Overview for pilots with different status as Overview for Manage (still not same as Retrieve board)

## Web interface items
- Allow admin to upload pilot and driver CSV directly (instead of requiring command line access)
- separate tables on same Overview page for the different events
**- Warm restart (renew latest status message, use /refresh and have another verify step)

## Structural items
- archive directory needs to be created (first time)
- Verify database is "live" after reload

## Retrieve support items
**- Track drivers
- Advanced automated retrieve handling (assigning retrieve driver):
    - Retrieve coordinator sends "DRA 127" to Bowerbird
      - Bowerbird sends driver DRA a pilot (#127) and location (the lat/long from #127 LOK)
      - Bowerbird sends pilot #127 a driver assignment (optional)

## Management support items
- Explicit message for unknown pilot number (currently just shows generic "ERROR")
- "WARNING" in Error log if name in message does not match pilot name in database
- List view with sortable headers (number, name, status)

## Admin support items
- Complete abstraction of the pilot record fields from the csv column headers (currently has some assumptions)
- grab the Driver View column headers from the csv (currently hardcoded)
- Check that handle_reset_confirm is being done the "right" way
- Add command to check pilot_list.csv and add any new pilot numbers (differs from complete "reset" which clears all data and loads completely from pilot_list). Question: should it reload information for known pilot numbers?
- "Event" field must not have spaces (or event-specific view does not work)

## Pilot support items
- SPOT MESSAGE PARSING ISSUES (check each year)
-- Need email parser for international SPOTs (sending email with extra preamble info to SMS recipient since don't have proper "@vtext.com" style phone recipients)
[workaround-ish: put pilot number (#000) into username so that BB at least SHOWS it]
- Receive an LOK from a SPOT, send ACK to associated cell phone (instead of back to SPOT cell forwarder)
- Update "acknowledge" message to be more specific. For example "Received #172 LOK"
- Probably should change to more generic special codes, for example
-- LMB -> LFX (Landed, but LOK message needs to be fixed)
-- SMB -> ERR (Inproper messages, see Retrieve Coordinator or Organizer)

==== PREVIOUS TO DO ITEMS ====
X Embed map on listview page showing last known location of all "LOK" pilots (AND Drivers!) [implemented as /map handler]
X lat/lon parsing only works for InReach, not SPOT (even if pasted in to /ups)
X support lower case driver codes
X Embed map on pilotview page (with pin on last known pilot location)
x- Convert lat/lon to clickable Google map link in pilotview
X Retrieve view not showing driver status
X Driver view not showing pilot status
X Update driver view with new columns
X Extract lat/lon from parsable messages (look for 'll='' and '(4[12]\.' and ...?)
x- Associate drivers with pilots
x- Overview of pilot grid showing the drivers assigned (not the pilot status, such as LOK) [Retrieve view]
x- List of drivers with the pilots who are currently assigned to them (only those still who are "LOK", not "PUP") [Drivers view]
X Review the log file to confirm it has all pertainent message processing details (was broken with Driver db addition)
X fix pilot detail view (cleaner super like std)
X filtering in Retrieve view shows previous status, even if it should be filtered (FLY followed by PUP shows FLY)
X Make index.html a true template and incorporate the nav_bar rendering system
x- Rename status directory to archive/status-<timestamp>
x- Reset needs to backup log files to archive/status and then zero out current version (it also has to backup status files - that may have been broken in db conversion)
x Put pilot information into actual database (instead of reading from CSV) [done 20190604]
x Save pilot status so can restart bb without losing all the current context [done 20190604]
x- Separate status channel for driver assignment info (show up in listview? or driverview?)
x- Split into different pages depending on which event (Race, Sprint, Clinic)
x- Add brief descriptions (mini-documentation) to Error and Logs pages (explain what to look for)
x- More structured navigation (separate Pilot information from Manage/Admin information)
x- Organizer (Manage/Admin) view (hidden from public)
x-- direct access to "Logs" (regular and error)
x Documentation directly accessible in Bowerbird (at least for Admin) [done 20190604]
x Links to instructions for pilots (could still be the google docs) [done 20190604]
x Link to google sheet for submitting tracking system details [done 20190604, in the google doc]
X NEW status options
x- LMB ("Landed per Mary Beth"): bright yellow, so not LOK, but still known to be safe
x- SMB ("See Mary Beth"): orange, so not FLY, but did not go properly and needs education

X confirm log date stamps in local time zone
X Convert incoming status message to upper (gt needs to check: this might be fixed)
X Auto-update (reload) Overview page
X "NOT" split into
X- "NOT" = known to not be flying today [changed to "ABS" for Absent]
X- "" (blank) = reset to start the day [left as "NOT", which is actually not displayed for visual noise reduction]
X /pilotview/### (direct access for a pilot to their own status and messages received)
X also accessible as /pilot/###
X make initial pilot log files in status directory
X update pilot status from last message in status file directory
X Check that the # of connections is sufficient (all pilots checking their status)
X /logs isn't working?! (what happened?)
X check for sample SPOT message
X turn on/configure new phone number
X update views
  X overview page
    X get the color key working again
    X get number to pop
    X show sample of all statuses
  X single pilot page
    X simple URL bowerbird.meteor.com/7 [http://bbtrack.me/pilot/7]
    X show message/status history, most current first
X robustify message parsing
  X parse SPOT messages
  X parse DeLorme messages
  X handle leading spaces
  X parse lat/lon out of DeLorme messages
  X parse lat/lon out of SPOT messages
  X add feedback for invalid pilot number [shows up in Error log]
X create an actual pilot object and stop being lazy [obsoleted with new db]
